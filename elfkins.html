        <h1>Elfkins iOS Application (2016)</h1>
        <p>
          Elfkins is an interactive toy that helps adults communicate with their children in creative and fun ways when
          they are apart. The Elfkins mobile app facilitates this communication by recording messages, adding gestures
          and sharing messages with other family members. Elfkins is a product of parent company Empath Interactive.
          To comply with an NDA, I will be omitting parts of the case study.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was responsible for the interaction design, iconography, packaging and some aspects of branding.
          This project was my first opportunity to own the end to end UX for a system. Having to make all the decisions
          from a design standpoint was very exciting as well as intimidating. The main challenge was getting the application
          ready to perform the core features defined in the product requirements spec, in time for an investor-demo.

        <h1>Making together happen anywhere</h1>
        <p>
          Elfkins app makes it easy for you to invite your trusted friends and family members to connect with
          your child and join your family circle where you can easily share voice messages as well as photos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giving your loved one the joy of receiving animated messages from everyone in their circle at the same
          time, on an important day as their birthday, becomes easy with scheduled event prompts on the app.

        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <p>
          Setting up permissions and settings for admins to make decisions as to who gets to adminstor their elfkinâ€™s account
          and who gets permissions to access a direct channel of communication with their elfkin was a big responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked with developers located in Russia for this project and managing effective communication
          while keeping the time difference in mind was also a challenge on this project.
