          <h3>Net Positive East Palo Alto</h3>
          <h4>Infographics</h4>
          The Net Positive East Palo Alto is a project of Sustainable Silicon Valley.
          As work on the project was underway there was need for more public awareness
          about why the project is vital. We chose infographics as a means for effective
          communication with the community and I was assigned the task of designing a series of them.

          Data recovered by the organization showed large differences in East Palo Alto
          when compared to the rest of Silicon Valley. The factors showing most disparity
          were education, population and income; the cities that showed a stark contrast
          from East Palo Alto were Atherton, Palo Alto and Mountain View. This was the
          reason for selecting these cities and factors for our infographics.

          <h3>Earth Day San Francisco</h3>
          <h4>Illustration &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; Print</h4>
          The SF Earth Day team wanted to promote the Street Fair by showcasing
          Earth Day posters, banners and flyers across the city as well as social media.

          Each year the Earth Day promotions involve multi-colored and cheerful posters
          and web-page designs.This year had to have the same tonality yet be refreshing
          and attractive. Simplistic Illustrations were a concept that had not been tried
          yet and they seemed like the ideal design voice this year.
