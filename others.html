          <h3>Instawork</h3>
          <h4>Website Redesign</h4>
          Instawork is a marketplace for local restaurant jobs. Their current business sign
          up page was not receiving enough sign ups. The task was to come up with a layout and
          redesign that makes most businesses want to use the site for finding their employees.

          Suggestions I made to Improve Sign Up rate:
          <ul>
            <li>In order to increase credibility we could use brand names upfront that are currently using the product.</li>
            <li>Instead of overwhelming them with long forms to fill out,we should ask for just an email address initially.</li>
            <li>Make a fun "3 step process" segment to highlight how simple the site would make their hiring process.</li>
            <li>Testimonials are great, especially if they come from credible sources, but instead of showing
              people's faces we should show the restaurant/brand as that will be more recognizable.</li>
            <li>Showing businesses how many candidates we have on our site, we could add a "tracker"
              that shows number of people hired on Instawork in the last few days/weeks.</li>

          <h3>Net Positive East Palo Alto</h3>
          <h4>Infographics</h4>
          The Net Positive East Palo Alto is a project of Sustainable Silicon Valley.
          As work on the project was underway there was need for more public awareness
          about why the project is vital. We chose infographics as a means for effective
          communication with the community and I was assigned the task of designing a series of them.

          Data recovered by the organization showed large differences in East Palo Alto
          when compared to the rest of Silicon Valley. The factors showing most disparity
          were education, population and income; the cities that showed a stark contrast
          from East Palo Alto were Atherton, Palo Alto and Mountain View. This was the
          reason for selecting these cities and factors for our infographics.

          <h3>Earth Day San Francisco</h3>
          <h4>Illustration &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp; Print</h4>
          The SF Earth Day team wanted to promote the Street Fair by showcasing
          Earth Day posters, banners and flyers across the city as well as social media.

      <div class='section'>
        <div>
          Each year the Earth Day promotions involve multi-colored and cheerful posters
          and web-page designs.This year had to have the same tonality yet be refreshing
          and attractive. Simplistic Illustrations were a concept that had not been tried
          yet and they seemed like the ideal design voice this year.
