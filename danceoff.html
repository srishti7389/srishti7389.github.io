        <h1>Dance Off (2015)</h1>
        <p>
          Dance Off is a boutique dance studio based in Palo Alto, California that
          promises to teach dancers and non-dancers the power and therapy of dance
          movement. The company wanted a branding that resonates with their values
          and makes them distinguishable. The key words from initial meetings were&mdash;
          strong, approachable, passionate and depicting movement.

        <h1>Design Solution</h1>
        <p>
          Dancers always perform in front of an audience or a mirror.
          The logo simply illustrates the connection that a dancer has with the audience. The audience reciprocates to the dancer by letting themselves flow and the dancer channels energy
          from the audience for her performance. Each letter shows a distinctive pose.
          The illustration of the flowy fabric shows movement and the colors evoke a sense of passion.

        <h1>Interface Design</h1>
        <p>
          The website was designed keeping a contemporary look and feel in mind.
          A well laid out grid system helped me in keeping the layout clean. The client wanted to
          use photographs instead of illustrations for the website to feature their current company dancers.

        <h1>Print Collateral</h1>
        <p>
          We used illustrations similar to the logo throughout the print collateral. The artwork and images involve flowy
          clothing and movements along with sharp shapes, building a cohesive look and feel in our branding.
