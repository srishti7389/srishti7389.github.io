        <h1>Dance Off</h1>
        <p>
          Dance Off is a boutique dance studio based in Palo Alto, California that
          promises to teach dancers and non-dancers the power and therapy of dance
          movement. The company wanted a branding that resonates with their values
          and makes them distinguishable. The key words from initial meetings were&mdash;
          strong, approachable, passionate and depicting movement.

          <h3>Design Solution</h3>
          Dancers are always performing in front of either an audience or a mirror.
          The logo simply illustrates the connection that a dancer has with the audience/
          with herself during practice. I used this reflective connection between the two
          as the solution for the logo. The second F is a reflection and line underneath
          which depicts the dependency one has on the other. The audience reciprocates
          to the dancer by letting themselves flow and the dancer attracts the energy
          from the audience for her performance. Each letter shows a distinctive shape.
          The illustration of the flowy fabric, showing movement, creates a sense of passion.

          <h3>Interface Design</h3>
          I designed the website keeping in mind the importance of a contemporary look and feel.
          A well laid out grid system helped me in keeping the layout clean. The client wanted to
          use photographs instead of illustrations for the website as they wanted their current
          dancers to be featured on the site.

          <h3>Print Collateral</h3>
          We decided to use illustrations throughout the print collateral as these would remain
          consistent and also made the brand look approachable. The artwork and images involve flowy
          clothing and movements along with sharp shapes, building a cohesive look and feel in our branding.
