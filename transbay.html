        <h1>Transbay Transit Center (2015)</h1>
        <p>
          The Transbay Center is a transit station and a neighborhood development project in downtown
          San Francisco that will serve the Bay Area's regional transportation system. It is currently under construction.
          This was a school project and my first technical project where I learnt and practiced user experience design.

        <h1>The Website</h1>
        <p>
          The brief stated that the Transbay center is more than just a “Transit” spot. It is a new neighborhood which has a wide variety of ammenities. The website was developed keeping these points in consideration—
          <span class='bullet'>easy to navigate, for commuters in a rush,</span>
          <span class='bullet'>technically up-to-date with a minimal, modern design for our tech-savvy Bay Area residents,</span>
          <span class='bullet'>family-friendly and inviting so users treat the Transbay Center as a fun spot for meals/events/shopping,</span>
          <span class='bullet'>the website needs to intuitively provide all the necessary information about the schedules of 11 different transportation carriers meeting at the transit center.</span>

        <h1>The Strategic Research</h1>
        <p>
          The first step was to conduct stakeholder interviews to understand what metrics defined success. I also communicated with potential users to find out what they would want from a site like this. The interviews highlighted that from a business standpoint, it was crucial users use the site to purchase their transit and event tickets as well as reserve seating at restaurants in the Transbay Center. For users, their key motivation was to find the easiest way to commute and to be able to pick up quick food. Users wanted to “find everything they would need (tickets, updates, schedules) for their commute in one place”.
        </p>
        <p>
          A competitor analysis highlighted successful features other transit hub sites were implementing and features they were falling short of.

        <h1>Personas and Task Analysis</h1>
        <p>
          To get a deeper insight into our user needs, motivations and pain points, I created multiple user
          personas and from that pool selected the primary persona, Dave around who the interface would be
          designed. While considering one of the secondary personas, I realized the need to add an event
          directory feature as it aligned with the requirements from the stakeholders and did not conflict
          with my primary persona. I then created a task analysis table that identified what Dave’s thought
          process would be when interacting with the site and his expected reaction to each feature segment.

        <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
        <p>
          Once the content and feature specifications were finalized I moved on to building the
          structure of the site. Since our content was limited and fairly straightforward I decided
          to use a hierarchical structure. There was going to be one index page which was the home
          page and all the features of the Center would form the sub-pages which in-turn had feature
          specific pages under them with the freedom of going back to a previous page.
        </p>

        <h1>Interactive Wireframes</h1>
        <p>
          To uncover any roadblocks before the visual design process takes place, I created quick,
          greyscale, interactive wireframes using Balsamiq. The idea was to focus on how the features
          and content would fit, how a user would flow through the site and if the information structure
          works well, and not get bogged down in details like colors, images, typography etc. Once the
          wireframes were presented in the class and we started discussing the flow, I discovered the
          need to eliminate  “extra” modal windows as they were making the user interaction much more
          complicated than necessary. I decided to add a ticket buying column into the same page as the
          schedule and planner as the user can instantly see what tickets he would need and how much they
          were going to cost him instead of having another page for them altogether. This also allowed
          users to make changes in their itinerary much more easily. Similar changes were made in the
          dine and relax page. Instead of having the user go through 2 pages to get his tickets for an
          event or make a reservation, he would now be able to do all of that in a single step.

          skeleton to create a cohesive look and feel and provide users with a delightful interface.

        <h1>Branding</h1>
        <p>
          After going through pages and pages of initial sketches, the design solution for the logo was
          selected as the one mirroring the shape of Transbay Center. I developed the logo in Illustrator.
          The orange used in the logo signifies the California Poppy. The rest of the color scheme was
          chosen from the artwork present in the flooring. Apart from the logo, I also got the opportunity to
          design the stationery, business cards, banners, signage, and a style manual for the Transbay Center.
          Although this was the first time I was working on designing a Style guide by myself for a Branding
          project, I quickly grasped the do’s and don’ts of an effective and well written style guide.
