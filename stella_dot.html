        <h1>Stella &amp; Dot - Case Study</h1>
        <p>
          The objective of this project was to redesign the category page and make it more
          engaging/ social by integrating user generated content with inventory &amp; model
          images, elevate the design of the page and use brand guidelines provided.

        <h1>Initial findings</h1>
        <p>
          After going through the heatmaps for the page the aspects that stood out were:
          <span class='bullet'>Clicks-heatmap clearly shows a significant drop in clicks after the 3rd row of products.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>But, there is only a gradual decrease in the number of people scrolling past the 3rd row, as derived from the graph below.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>The current design is clean and consistent. However generates significantly lower CTR on products below the first fold.</span>
          As a user scrolls through, she might become overwhelmed with the options and it would become harder for her to choose
          (paradox of choice?). We need to help her make a decision by either making certain products stand out more than others,
          or adding social validation to reinforce her choice.

        <h1>Redesign&mdash;Option 1</h1>
        <p>
          The first direction was to have a Slider at the top of the page displaying a user image along with her comment.
          This would provide a social proof to the user as soon as she lands on the website. A “Trending Section”
          after a few rows of products with curated UGC interspersed with model images, shows the product on hover.
        </p>
        <p class='half-width' title='Pros'>
          <span class='bullet'>Clean, consistent layout of inventory.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>Having a trending section after a few rows of products breaks browser monotony.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>Top slider should increase user interaction with popular styles, giving them immediate social proof.</span>
        </p>
        <p class='half-width' title='Cons'>
          <span class='bullet'>Because no products have been displayed before the top slider, it might feel out of context.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>Hiding inventory behind a ‘view all’ button might reduce checkout conversions as users prefer
            scrolling to clicking and would not be too keen on clicking a button to see more inventory.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>Above-the-fold real estate is expensive, and is being taken away by UGC.</span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img src="resources/stella_dot/sketches/1.jpg" />

        <h1>Redesign&mdash;Option 2</h1>
        <p>
          UGC shown in-line with the products, with context, so when a product gas been displayed a UGC with that product will appear.
          A “ticker” that shows thumbnails of curated user submitted images, along with the user’s id, and the name of the product she
          is sporting. For social validation, prominently show number  of times product has been bought or shared on social media.
          This option maximizes chance to capture viewer’s clicks from a user image.
        </p>
        <p class='half-width' title='Pros'>
          <span class='bullet'>By adding a “shared x times” data on a hover, we are providing users with immediate social proof.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>UGC in this option islinked with product images contextually and it reinforces a user’s preference immediately.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>Ticker with images shared on social media breaks browsing monotony, provides a “social” avenue to capture user clicks.</span>
        </p>
        <p class='half-width' title='Cons'>
          <span class='bullet'>Product layout may not be as clean and symmetric as Option 1.</span>
          <span class='bullet'>User images need to be curated to match the look and feel of the category page.</span>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>After careful consideration of the pros and cons of both the options, I decided to use Option 2 as the direction.</p>
