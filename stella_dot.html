        <h1>Stella &amp; Dot - Category Pages<br/>Case Study</h1>
        <p>
          The objective of this project was to redesign the category page and make it more
          engaging/ social by integrating user generated content with inventory &amp; model
          images, elevate the design of the page and use brand guidelines provided.

          <h3>Initial findings</h3>
          After going through the heatmaps for the page the aspects that stood out were:
          <ol>
            <li>Clicks-heatmap clearly shows a significant drop in clicks after the 3rd row of products.</li>
            <li>But,there is only a gradual decrease in the number of people scrolling past the 3rd row, as derived from the graph below.</li>
            <li>The current design is clean and consistent. However generates significantly lower CTR on products below the first fold.
              As a user scrolls through, she might become overwhelmed with the options and it would become harder for her to choose
              (paradox of choice?). We need to help her make a decision by either making certain products stand out more than others,
              or adding social validation to reinforce her choice.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3 style='text-align: center;'>Possible Directions for Redesign after doing the Market Research</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Incorporating UGC with some context to the product will reinforce a user’s preference in the product (like Modcloth).
              Having UGC without context might leave the user confused/distracted from the purpose of the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Showing social validation to make products stand out will again help users in making a choice. Ways to do this could be:-
              <ol style='margin: 0px 20px;'>
                <li>products “viewed” or “bought” by others - (like Expedia)</li>
                <li>most liked on FB - (like Levi’s)</li>
                <li>user reviews - (like Airbnb)</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Making the site look dynamic will increase engagement (like ESPNCricinfo, Tieks)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Based on these findings I went on to quickly sketch multiple directions for the interface design and
            from over 10 skecthes narrowed down to 2 options which were validating the above points the most.

      <div class='section'>
        <div> <img src="resources/stella_dot/sketches/1.jpg" expand="" /> </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Option 1</h3>
          <p>
            The first direction was to have a Slider at the top of the page displaying a user image along with her comment.
            This would provide a social proof to the user as soon as she lands on the website. A “Trending Section”
            after a few rows of products with curated UGC interspersed with model images, shows the product on hover.
          </p>
          <h4 class='inline'>Pros</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean, consistent layout of inventory.</li>
            <li>Having a trending section after a few rows of products breaks browser monotony.</li>
            <li>Top slider should increase user interaction with popular styles, giving them immediate social proof.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class='inline'>Cons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Because no products have been displayed before the top slider, it might feel out of context.</li>
            <li>Hiding inventory behind a ‘view all’ button might reduce checkout conversions as users prefer
              scrolling to clicking and would not be too keen on clicking a button to see more inventory.</li>
            <li>Above-the-fold real estate is expensive, and is being taken away by UGC.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class='section'>
        <div>
          <h3>Option 2</h3>
          <p>
            UGC shown in-line with the products, with context, so when a product
            gas been displayed a UGC with that product will appear.<br/>
            A “ticker” that shows thumbnails of curated user submitted images, along
            with the user’s id, and the name of the product she is sporting.<br/>
            For social validation, prominently show number  of times product has been bought or shared on
            social media. This option maximizes chance to capture viewer’s clicks from a user image.<br/>
          </p>
          <h4 class='inline'>Pros</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>By adding a “shared x times” data on a hover, we are providing users with immediate social proof.</li>
            <li>UGC in this option islinked with product images contextually and it reinforces a user’s preference immediately.</li>
            <li>Ticker with images shared on social media breaks browsing monotony, provides a “social” avenue to capture user clicks.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 class='inline'>Cons</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Product layout may not be as clean and symmetric as Option 1.</li>
            <li>User images need to be curated to match the look and feel of the category page.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After careful consideration of the pros and cons of both the options, I decided to use Option 2 as the direction.</p>

          <img src="resources/stella_dot/website/1.png" expand="" style='margin: 80px 0;'/>
          <p>
            On presenting the Version 1 to Product managers and design team, along with the research to back
            up my design decisions, I was given some constructive feedback and the areas that needed work were:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>UGC spanning over 2 columns of product images can be very distracting and takes away from the inventory.</li>
            <li>Circular UGC thumbnails don’t relate to instagram and can be confusing.</li>
            <li>The “Instagrammed over 5 times” makes the product description cluttered and needs to be placed elsewehere.</li>
          </ol>
