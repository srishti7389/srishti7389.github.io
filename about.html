          <h2>The Short Bio</h2>
          <span>
            I’m a user interface and experience designer living in Palo Alto. I strive
            to create experiences that not only help users but also acheive business goals.
            In my spare time I conduct dance classes &amp; workshops, cook and practice yoga.

          <h2>The Story</h2>
          <span>
            I lived most of my life in the traditional city of Chennai, India.
            I’ve always been an admirer of expressive arts. I became a professional
            dance instructor at the age of 16. Chose my “main” career in computer
            science very early on and straight out of college started working
            for a major IT company in India where, surprisingly, my awesome
            organization and public speaking skills helped me. Two years into
            the job, I decided to quit and move to California with my amazing
            <a href='https://www.facebook.com/shubham.mittal' target='_blank'>husband</a>.
            It’s when I realized I wanted to take a few steps back and follow my
            dream of getting paid for thinking and solving problems creatively.
            I went back to school and took on lots of passion projects to fight
            my way into this competitive industry. I worked as a visual design
            volunteer for an organization, which is improving environmental and
            resource conservation in Silicon Valley. I believe we are living in
            the most exciting and innovative times and want to make the best of it.
