        <h1>Elevate Redesign (2016&ndash;2017)</h1>
        <p>
          Elevate is CPP, Inc.'s assessment delivery platform, used by thousands of practitioners
          with psychology majors and a license to administer the personality tests that CPP publishes.
          Elevate facilitates sending assessments to up to 5,000 end users in a project and provides
          powerful tools to help them manage all of the end user data, download and email assessment reports.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the Lead UI designer on the project and worked very closely with the Elevate product
          manager and the user experience researcher. I was responsible for designing the interface,
          building a design system and icon library and crafting some user flows.

      <ul><li>
        <h3>Our Users</h3>
      	<p>Older, non-tech savvy users, ages 45&ndash;55, mainly women, generally afraid to click around. We have had customers who didn't know how to paste a link once it was copied.</p>
      </li><li class='heading'>
        <h1>Challenges faced</h1>
      </li><li>
        <h3>Voice of the customer</h3>
        <p>One of our main sources of understanding the users came from our Customer Relations team who spend hours talking to our users and explaining the system to them. </p>
      </li><li>
        <h3>Aggressive timeline</h3>
        <p>This meant ensuring our solutions were not causing big changes to the back-end architecture.</p>
      </li><li>
        <h3>Lack of Data</h3>
        <p>We did not have any analytics set up on the old site that could help us make data-driven decisions, which meant a lot of the times we were shooting in the dark. </p>
      </li><li>
        <h3>Innovation versus Repair</h3>
        <p>As much as we wanted to innovate new solutions and restructure the assessment delivery platform, at this point, we were all basically trying to fix what's broken.</p>
      </li></ul>

        <h1>Cleaning up the process</h1>
        <p>Part of the reason I was hired was to help the team at CPP, streamline their design process. I started with the introduction of the Adobe suite for all interface design. Before I joined, UI design specs for every page were being calibrated and documented manually, bringing down productivity by 30%. We didn't have a lot of time to experiment with different tools so I did some research before presenting Zeplin to the team.</p>
        <p class='quotes'>Getting us on Zeplin has had an enormous impact on development's through-put with redesign. They are literally addressing way beyond our original scope, because of how much faster they can code with the Zeplin specs. Big kudos to you for bringing this tool to CPP.</p>

        <h1>Divvying up the project into flows</h1>
        <p>Re-design was divided into 5 flows that are pivotal to a user's journey. Lower priority flows were pushed into a 're-skin' bucket due to lack of time and resources.</p>

	      <h1>Kicking off design</h1>
	      <p>Every design sprint kick off included a whiteboarding session the product manager, UX designer and I had, mapping out the user journey and identifying a high level flow. This exercise helped us understand basic requirements and opportunities for enhancements.</p>

        <h1>Projects Table</h1>
	      <p>Projects table is a practitioner's home. It's where they get a quick insight into all of their projects' progress, giving them options to group projects into different categories. Bulk actions on a project level can be performed from the table.</p>
        <p>Understanding how the system works has always been a challenge for first-time users. We designed an empty state that guided users into quickly creating their first project, and also gave them a high-level overview of how the system works. To see all project table mocks click here.</p>

        <p>Editing an end user's information, reminding them to complete their assessments, tracking an individual's progress, downloading and emailing reports, creating and editing teams and pairs, sending support materials, downloading a project's summary, were some of the capabilities that we provide practitioners with  when they choose to dig deeper into their project's detail.</p>
	      <p>Apart from providing the functionality on an individual level, we also provided users with quick access to their routine tasks in bulk.</p>

        <h1>Iconography</h1>
	      <p>Re-design provided an opportunity for us to shift away from our dull, corporate presence to something where our practitioners can get their work done but also enjoy moments of visual delights. Before re-design, our users often complained that, for a personality development company, we didn't seem to exude any through our platforms.</p>

        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p>We created two different documentation specs for the project. The functional spec consisted of an in-depth breakdown of all the case scenarios and user journeys. This spec was a constantly evolving document that demanded a lot of time and effort to maintain. Apart from the functional spec, which was a team effort, I created a visual design document that highlights the elements in the Elevate design system and their interaction patterns.</p>

    <div id='learning'>
      <div class='content'>
	      <h1>What I've learnt</h1>
	      <p>A lot of the work that we did was goverened by when development needed the designs, which meant many times we were more focussed on getting it done rather than getting it right. This works when you are trying to build an MVP, but when you already that have an MVP that you're supposed to fix, you want to make sure that users aren't disappointed another time.</p>
        <p>Although we did get a good response from our users, there were still some inconsistencies in the flows we  had to fix Post Go-Live. We were gauging success by the number and length of calls CR receives once we went live.</p>
        <p class='quotes'>
          NICELY DONE!<br/>
          I know I have been one of your biggest critics, but just looked at your Sneak Peak &ndash; it looks great. A huge improvement, and exactly what we need!"
        </p>
        <p class='quotes'>I love the new CPP Elevate features.<br/>
          I sincerely appreciate you proactive design, development & implementation based on customer feedback.<br/>The new CPP Elevate features are intuitive and user friendly.

    <div id='still-fixing'>
      <div class='content'>
        <h1>We're still fixing..</h1>
	      <p>Here's an issue I worked on after receiving several calls from our users who were confused about what type of project they were using and why they were different now.</p>
        <p>
          Problem:  In step 1 of Creating your project, we give you the options to choose between the two types of projects. However, to make the process easier for users we had defaulted to the most common type of project most users use.
          Since this meant users weren't required to perform an action on this, it turns out they completely missed the step altogether. When they finish creating their project and would want to add respondents they would or would not be able to depending on the type of project they selected.
          Changing a project's ‘type' is not possible once they create it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solution:  Step 1—I eliminated giving users a defaulting option. This was an important decision for users to make and doing this meant they would be forced to go over their options before chosing one.
          Step 2— Instead of providing them with the options directly, which would cause confusion (since this was a new concept to them) I opted for asking them how they want to send their assessments.
          This is the core of selecting a type of project and the answer  would automaticaly provide them with the type of project that works best for them.
