          Liz Wells is a user experience designer based in Brooklyn, New York. Her work
          combines her background in graphic design with technology and user-centered
          design thinking. Her UX process begins with sketching as a way of stepping back
          from her computer to just focus on the experience and user goals at hand. Liz is
          currently working at Stink Studios, where he is responsible for all phases of the
          UX process, from concepting and information architecture to wireframing and
          prototyping. Liz advises visual designers and developers throughout the lifecycle
          of a project to help them meet Stink’s high standards for usability and delight.
          While at Stink Studios, Liz has created products and experiences for a wide range
          of brands in music, automotive, technology, media, and nonprofit.
        </p>

          Liz received her BFA in Graphic Design from the Rochester Institute of
          Technology in 2015 and her foundation in design thinking informs her work as a
          UX designer. In 2017, Liz was a finalist for the Young Guns 15 award by the The
          One Club for Creativity/ADC. She has a passion for raising the voices of women
          and non-binary people in the workplace. She and a coworker recently started
          Desk Lunch, a newsletter for people to share their experiences of working in the
          creative industry.
