        <h1>Solutions Showcase (2014)</h1>
        <p>
          The Solutions Showcase is a platform for companies to share sustainable ideas with other
          companies to reduce our carbon footprint and the use of non-renewable resources. The task
          was to design a web interface allowing users to browse through thousands of submitted
          solutions and adapt the ones that fit their requirement. The product also incorporated a
          platform for companies to upload their own solutions. Since there was a lot of information
          to be presented, I created a well-balanced architecture providing users with what they need,
          when they need it. The final experince was simple, fast, adaptive and intuitive.

        <h1>Market Research</h1>
        <p>
          The market for presenting solutions to environmental issues was being led by companies like
          OpenIDEO and VirtualExpo.The first step was performing a thorough analysis between these market
          leaders to uncover areas where we could stand out, and learn from strategies these products use
          that make them successful. We compared these to our initial list of features that was set by the
          business. Our competitors were lacking a few features including customizing solution profile by
          users and certain searching limitations like “search by a category” and “search by a company”.

        <h1>Defining Strategic Objectives</h1>
        <p>
          To bring more clarity to our objective and focus on features that were truly necessary
          in the time frame allotted. I used a red route analysis graph that highlighted which
          features are worth spending UXD efforts on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compromises had to be made. Even though stakeholders strongly suggested the need to reduce
          redundancy in similar solutions, we could not afford to spend time on it. We had limited resources,
          had we proceeded with the feature we would have need to manual filter out redundant solutions.
